Non-public group chat with easy file sharing - work in progress


## About

bivouac is a work in progress project which aims to provide an open-source
software package which allows to easily setup and run non-public web-based
group chats with dead-simple file-sharing (drag a file into the chat, and
it's immediately available as a download for all chat members).

Besides those "feature goal", my secondary goal is to learn how to architect
Node.js applications that are relatively complex, with domain-driven design
and a strong separation of concerns in mind.

bivouac is written in JavaScript, for the Node.js platform.
